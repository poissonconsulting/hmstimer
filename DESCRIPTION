Description: 
    Tracks elapsed clock time using a `hms::hms()` scalar, 
    which if running has an attribute named start 
    that specifies the system time when the timer was started.
    The elapsed time is the value of the scalar 
    plus the difference between the current system time 
    and the system time when the timer was started.
