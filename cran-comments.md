This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added '()' behind all function names (e.g. difftime() without quotation marks) in the Description text.

*This is a new submission*

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  difftime (12:20)
  hms (2:8, 11:39)
  
*The words are spelt correctly*

The Title field should be in title case. Current version is:
‘hms Based Timer’
In title case that is:
‘Hms Based Timer’

*This is intentional*
